## Getting started

### Prerequisites
Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 (preferably the latest version), platform toolset v142 and Windows 10 SDK (preferably 10.0.18362.0) are required in order to compile GOESP. If you don't have ones, you can download VS [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (Tools and Windows SDK are installed during Visual Studio Setup).

### Downloading
There are two options of downloading the source code:

#### Without [git](https://git-scm.com)

Choose this option if you want pure source and you're not going to contribute to the repo. Download size ~600 kB.

To download source code this way [click here](https://github.com/danielkrupinski/GOESP/archive/master.zip).

#### With [git](https://git-scm.com)

Choose this option if you're going to contribute to the repo or you want to use version control system. Git is required to step further, if not installed download it [here](https://git-scm.com).

Open git command prompt and enter following command:

    git clone https://github.com/danielkrupinski/GOESP.git

`GOESP` folder should have been succesfully created, containing all the source files.

## FAQ

Yes, GOESP shouldn't collide with any other game modification.
